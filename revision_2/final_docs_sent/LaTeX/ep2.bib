journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
abstract = {A non-neutral model (NNM) of the axial plasma discharge in a Hall thruster, including full electron inertia, is presented. In the finite-volume formulation, two types of sheath boundary conditions previously used in the literature are tested and proven to behave practically identically in this model. Both normal and reversed (i.e. electron repelling and attracting, respectively) anode sheaths are admitted. This model is compared with the quasineutral model developed in a previous work, which includes only azimuthal electron inertia and normal anode sheaths. Both models agree excellently within the parametric region where steady-state solutions with a normal anode sheath exist. The NNM shows the absence of steady-state solutions with a reversed anode sheath. Nonetheless, a reversed sheath can appear during the transient to a steady-state solution with a normal sheath and the periodic transition from a normal to a reversed sheath can be observed in the presence of breathing-mode oscillations. In other cases, the reversed sheath leads to the discharge shut-off. Full electron inertia is always important in the presence of a reversed sheath. The parametric threshold of the wall accommodation parameter from a stationary solution to a breathing mode one differs slightly between the non-neutral and the quasi-neutral model.}

  abstract = {A fully cylindrical Hall thruster prototype was tested in the power range of 30--300 W with the objective of understanding the behavior of the discharge as a function of input parameters. Various operating conditions were compared, including two magnetic field configurations, a set of propellant mass flow rates, and a range of discharge voltages. Plasma properties were measured in the plume, with a Langmuir probe, a retarding potential analyzer, and a Faraday cup. The experimental results showed that the mass flow rate strongly affects the ionization and, consequently, other related properties such as the plasma density, currents, and propellant utilization. The discharge voltage also appeared to influence the ion energy and propellant utilization. The performance accessible from the measured magnitudes is assessed, resulting in a maximum thrust efficiency of about 18\% at 0.35 mg s{\`A}1 and 168 W.},

title = {Pulsed plasma thruster exhaust reconstruction},
journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
abstract = {The transient exhaust of an ablative pulsed plasma thruster is characterized experimentally for three capacitances and three discharge voltages, for discharge energies below 11 J. A novel analysis technique is introduced, which reconstructs the exhaust as a superposition of different Maxwellian-like ion groups. Each ion group is characterized by its own mean velocity, thermal spread, initial density, generation time and divergence rate. The time series of three probes working in the ion saturation regime are used to determine the model parameters by least-squares fitting. This approach allows a higher level of accuracy and insight than time-of-flight analysis based on direct feature correlation alone. A good fit of the main part of the discharge time series is achieved with just three ion groups, with mean velocities ranging in 50–70, 30–45 and 10–25 km s−1 respectively. Each ion group differs in the lateral divergence rate and axial thermal spread, and potentially corresponds with a different charge/mass ratio and/or creation time. Some trends with bank capacitance and discharge voltage are identified and discussed.}

 abstract = {Plasma thrusters are c{Hall}enging the monopoly of chemical thrusters in space propulsion. The specific energy that can be deposited into a plasma beam is orders of magnitude larger than the specific chemical energy of known fuels. Plasma thrusters constitute a vast family of devices ranging from already commercial thrusters to incipient laboratory prototypes. Figures of merit in plasma propulsion are discussed. Plasma processes and conditions differ widely from one thruster to another, with the pre-eminence of magnetized, weakly collisional plasmas. Energy is imparted to the plasma via either energetic electron injection, biased electrodes or electromagnetic irradiation. Plasma acceleration can be electrothermal, electrostatic or electromagnetic. Plasma–wall interaction affects energy deposition and erosion of thruster elements, and thus is central for thruster efficiency and lifetime. Magnetic confinement and magnetic nozzles are present in several devices. Oscillations and turbulent transport are intrinsic to the performances of some thrusters. Several thrusters are selected in order to discuss these relevant plasma phenomena.}
