    abstract = "{Long wavelength plasma non-uniformities rotating in the azimuthal direction (“rotating spokes”) have been observed in a number of experiments on Hall thrusters or magnetron discharges. We use a two-dimensional (2D), axial-azimuthal particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collisions model to study the formation of instabilities in a direct current magnetron discharge under conditions close to recent experiments. Despite the simplified 2D geometry of the model, the simulations can reproduce the main features of the experimental results. At a given position above the cathode, corresponding to the spoke location, the simulations show large amplitude oscillations of the plasma density and a very sharp increase in the plasma potential and electron temperature at the leading edge of the spoke, as in time resolved probe measurements. Moreover, the simulations show that the instability evolves in time from a gradient-drift type of instability in the linear phase, to an ionization wave in the non-linear phase, with rotation in the +E×B direction in the first phase and in the −E×B direction in the second phase. The number of spokes is found to increase with pressure, as in experiments. The mechanisms of electron heating and the role of the B×∇B drift in electron heating and in the coherence and direction of spoke rotation are discussed.}",

  Abstract                 = {Porous scaffold dowels of Ti(6)Al(4)V were prepared and implanted into cancellous and cortical bone sites in adult sheep. Cancellous implants were examined under gap, line-to-line, and press-fit conditions, whereas line-to-line implantation was used in cortical sites. Cortical shear strength increased significantly with time and reached 26.1 ± 8.6 MPa at 12 weeks, accompanied by a concomitant increase in bone integration and remodeling. In cancellous sites, bone integration was well established at 4 and 12 weeks under conditions of press-fit and line-to-line match between implant and surgical defect. New bone growth was also found in the gap conditions, although to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that the porous Ti(6)Al(4)V could prove an effective scaffold material for uncemented fixation in cortical and cancellous sites.},

    abstract = "{The kinetic study of plasma sheaths is critical, among other things, to understand the deposition of heat on walls, the effect of sputtering, and contamination of the plasma with detrimental impurities. The plasma sheath also provides a boundary condition and can often have a significant global impact on the bulk plasma. In this paper, kinetic studies of classical sheaths are performed with the continuum kinetic code, Gkeyll, which directly solves the Vlasov-Maxwell equations. The code uses a novel version of the finite-element discontinuous Galerkin scheme that conserves energy in the continuous-time limit. The fields are computed using Maxwell equations. Ionization and scattering collisions are included; however, surface effects are neglected. The aim of this work is to introduce the continuum kinetic method and compare its results with those obtained from an already established finite-volume multi-fluid model also implemented in Gkeyll. Novel boundary conditions on the fluids allow the sheath to form without specifying wall fluxes, so the fluids and fields adjust self-consistently at the wall. The work presented here demonstrates that the kinetic and fluid results are in agreement for the momentum flux, showing that in certain regimes, a multi-fluid model can be a useful approximation for simulating the plasma boundary. There are differences in the electrostatic potential between the fluid and kinetic results. Further, the direct solutions of the distribution function presented here highlight the non-Maxwellian distribution of electrons in the sheath, emphasizing the need for a kinetic model. The densities, velocities, and the potential show a good agreement between the kinetic and fluid results. However, kinetic physics is highlighted through higher moments such as parallel and perpendicular temperatures which provide significant differences from the fluid results in which the temperature is assumed to be isotropic. Besides decompression cooling, the heat flux is shown to play a role in the temperature differences that are observed, especially inside the collisionless sheath.}",

keywords = {Shock instability, Carbuncle phenomenon, HLLC, High-order schemes, WENO, Low-dissipation schemes},
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the application of high-order methods in combination with the popular HLLC Riemann solver demonstrates that the grid-aligned shock instability can strongly affect simulation results when the grid resolution is increased. Beyond the well-documented two-dimensional behavior, the problem is particularly troublesome with three-dimensional simulations. Hence, there is a need for shock-stable modifications of HLLC-type solvers for high-speed flow simulations. Second, the paper provides a stabilization of the popular HLLC flux based on a recently proposed mechanism for grid aligned-shock instabilities Fleischmann et al. (2020) [8]. The instability was found to be triggered by an inappropriate scaling of acoustic and advection dissipation for local low Mach numbers. These low Mach numbers occur during the calculation of fluxes in transverse direction of the shock propagation, where the local velocity component vanishes. A centralized formulation of the HLLC flux is provided for this purpose, which allows for a simple reduction of nonlinear signal speeds. In contrast to other shock-stable versions of the HLLC flux, the resulting HLLC-LM flux reduces the inherent numerical dissipation of the scheme. The robustness of the proposed scheme is tested for a comprehensive range of cases involving strong shock waves. Three-dimensional single- and multi-component simulations are performed with high-order methods to demonstrate that the HLLC-LM flux also copes with latest challenges of compressible high-speed computational fluid dynamics.}

abstract = {With a few hundred spacecraft launched to date with electric propulsion (EP), it is possible to conduct an epidemiological study of EP's on orbit reliability. The first objective of the present work was to undertake such a study and analyze EP's track record of on orbit anomalies and failures by different covariates. The second objective was to provide a comparative analysis of EP's failure rates with those of chemical propulsion. Satellite operators, manufacturers, and insurers will make reliability- and risk-informed decisions regarding the adoption and promotion of EP on board spacecraft. This work provides evidence-based support for such decisions. After a thorough data collection, 162 EP-equipped satellites launched between January 1997 and December 2015 were included in our dataset for analysis. Several statistical analyses were conducted, at the aggregate level and then with the data stratified by severity of the anomaly, by orbit type, and by EP technology. Mean Time To Anomaly (MTTA) and the distribution of the time to (minor/major) anomaly were investigated, as well as anomaly rates. The important findings in this work include the following: (1) Post-2005, EP's reliability has outperformed that of chemical propulsion; (2) Hall thrusters have robustly outperformed chemical propulsion, and they maintain a small but shrinking reliability advantage over gridded ion engines. Other results were also provided, for example the differentials in MTTA of minor and major anomalies for gridded ion engines and Hall thrusters. It was shown that: (3) Hall thrusters exhibit minor anomalies very early on orbit, which might be indicative of infant anomalies, and thus would benefit from better ground testing and acceptance procedures; (4) Strong evidence exists that EP anomalies (onset and likelihood) and orbit type are dependent, a dependence likely mediated by either the space environment or differences in thrusters duty cycles; (5) Gridded ion thrusters exhibit both infant and wear-out failures, and thus would benefit from a reliability growth program that addresses both these types of problems.}

title = {Inductive pulsed plasma thruster model with time-evolution of energy and state properties},
journal = {Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics},
abstract = {A model for pulsed inductive plasma acceleration is presented that consists of a set of circuit equations coupled to both a one-dimensional (1D) equation of motion and an equation governing the partitioning of energy. The latter two equations are obtained for the plasma current sheet by treating it as a single element of finite volume and integrating the governing equations over that volume. The integrated terms are replaced where necessary by physically equivalent approximations that are calculated through the solution of other parts of the governing equation set. The model improves upon previous 1D performance models by permitting the time-evolution of the temperature consistent with the time-varying energy flux into the plasma. The plasma state properties are also more realistically modelled and evolved in time, allowing for the tailoring of the model to different gases that may be chosen as propellants. Computational results for argon propellant are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the model. The model produces a result where efficiency is maximized at a given value of the electrodynamic scaling term known as the dynamic impedance parameter. The scaling of different energy sinks as a function of the dynamic impedance parameter provides insight into the global energy partitioning in these types of accelerators. Results from the present model deviate from the previous version where temperature is selected as an input without regard for the energy that would be deposited to heat the gas to that temperature. Qualitatively and quantitatively, the model predicts specific impulse values that compare favourably with those measured for two separate inductive pulsed plasma thrusters. Efficiency is underpredicted in the regime where data are available, but the trends in the data and simulations follow similar trajectories that appear to be converging towards a predicted peak efficiency as the dynamic impedance parameter is increased.}

ABSTRACT = {Measurements of ion speed in the plume of a pulsed high-current vacuum arc thruster were performed by means of electrostatic probes. The probes were designed to provide direct speed measurements with minimum disturbance on the plasma jet. Typical mean values of vi for Ti and Cu cathodes are determined at different locations downstream of the electrodes, in the far field region. From one VAT discharge to another, the mean ion speed strongly varies which leads to a large statistical dispersion. Single-shot analysis allows the observation of the plume anisotropy and its high divergence as well as the existence of several ion groups of different speeds throughout a discharge.},

abstract = {A hydrodynamic model of the vacuum arc thruster and its plume is described. Primarily an effect of the magnetic field on the plume expansion and plasma generation is considered. Two particular examples are investigated, namely the magnetically enhanced co-axial vacuum arc thruster (MVAT) and the vacuum arc thruster with ring electrodes (RVAT). It is found that the magnetic field significantly decreases the plasma plume radial expansion under typical conditions. Predicted plasma density profiles in the plume of the MVAT are compared with experimental profiles, and generally a good agreement is found. In the case of the RVAT the influence of the magnetic field leads to plasma jet deceleration, which explains the non-monotonic dependence of the ion current density, on an axial magnetic field observed experimentally.}

abstract = {Central schemes may serve as universal finite-difference methods for solving nonlinear convection–diffusion equations in the sense that they are not tied to the specific eigenstructure of the problem, and hence can be implemented in a straightforward manner as black-box solvers for general conservation laws and related equations governing the spontaneous evolution of large gradient phenomena. The first-order Lax–Friedrichs scheme (P. D. Lax, 1954) is the forerunner for such central schemes. The central Nessyahu–Tadmor (NT) scheme (H. Nessyahu and E. Tadmor, 1990) offers higher resolution while retaining the simplicity of the Riemann-solver-free approach. The numerical viscosity present in these central schemes is of order O((Δx)2r/Δt). In the convective regime where Δt∼Δx, the improved resolution of the NT scheme and its generalizations is achieved by lowering the amount of numerical viscosity with increasing r. At the same time, this family of central schemes suffers from excessive numerical viscosity when a sufficiently small time step is enforced, e.g., due to the presence of degenerate diffusion terms. In this paper we introduce a new family of central schemes which retain the simplicity of being independent of the eigenstructure of the problem, yet which enjoy a much smaller numerical viscosity (of the corresponding order O(Δx)2r−1)). In particular, our new central schemes maintain their high-resolution independent of O(1/Δt), and letting Δt ↓ 0, they admit a particularly simple semi-discrete formulation. The main idea behind the construction of these central schemes is the use of more precise information of the local propagation speeds. Beyond these CFL related speeds, no characteristic information is required. As a second ingredient in their construction, these central schemes realize the (nonsmooth part of the) approximate solution in terms of its cell averages integrated over the Riemann fans of varying size. The semi-discrete central scheme is then extended to multidimensional problems, with or without degenerate diffusive terms. Fully discrete versions are obtained with Runge–Kutta solvers. We prove that a scalar version of our high-resolution central scheme is nonoscillatory in the sense of satisfying the total-variation diminishing property in the one-dimensional case and the maximum principle in two-space dimensions. We conclude with a series of numerical examples, considering convex and nonconvex problems with and without degenerate diffusion, and scalar and systems of equations in one- and two-space dimensions. Time evolution is carried out by the third- and fourth-order explicit embedded integration Runge–Kutta methods recently proposed by A. Medovikov (1998). These numerical studies demonstrate the remarkable resolution of our new family of central scheme.}

title = {Early stage of the discharge in ablative pulsed plasma thrusters},
journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
abstract = {Currently the renewed interest in ablative pulsed plasma thrusters (APPTs) mostly results from the needs of satellites of the nano and micro sectors. However, the efficiency of APPTs significantly decreases when they are scaled down. A better understanding of the physical processes involved in plasma generation and maintenance in this type of thruster may help to minimize APPTs’ performance degradation, when they are miniaturized. One of the issues, which up to now seems to be only marginally clarified, is an initial phase of discharge between the APPT’s electrodes. In this paper a novel analytical model of a flashover development is proposed. In the model, movement of electrons between the PPT’s electrodes is described relying on the concept of a saturated secondary electron avalanche. Two analytical approaches are considered. In the simplest approach, secondary electrons are assumed to be monoenergetic, whereas in the second, the Maxwellian distribution function is assumed. Simple, analytical formulas for surface current density, electron density and the thickness of the electron layer are derived. The predicted values are in a good agreement with measurements and computer simulations of other authors. The work was inspired by experimental examination of a micro APPT fed with polymeric nonvolatile propellant. For completeness, the thruster, known as an LμPPT (liquid micro pulsed plasma thruster), is described and its performance is presented.}

abstract = {Perfluoropolyether (PFPE), as a non-volatile liquid propellant for pulsed plasma thrusters (PPTs), has exhibited potential for inhibiting carbon deposition compared with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). However, previous investigations have not focused on the ablation process of PPTs when using PFPE. In this study, ablation and the formation of carbon deposition were assessed based on ablated product analysis, element distributions, long-duration exposure images and emission spectroscopy. The results showed that the ablated products of PTFE were mainly CF and CF2, with a small amount of C, while PFPE was more likely to evaporate or generate molecules with large molecular weights. Carbon deposition on the ablated surface of PTFE was confirmed by the element distribution, while no obvious carbon deposition was found on the ablated surface of the porous ceramic. Carbon deposition was inevitable when using PTFE as a propellant according to the ablated products. The current density near the anode on the ablated surface of the propellant was low, and carbon could not be ablated in a timely manner; thus, carbon deposition easily occurred. For PFPE, the discharge arc was evenly distributed on the ablated surface, which could limit deposition.}

journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
abstract = {We present high-order accuracy simulations of the plasma-sheath transition with an ion–electron multi-fluid model that considers the electron inertial terms and the ion pressure gradient. By means of a third-order accuracy time-dependent finite volume scheme, we solve the isothermal multi-fluid equations with realistic ion-to-electron mass ratios. We propose a numerical procedure and boundary conditions that retrieve a steady-state solution of a planar 1D floating sheath. The classical solution to this problem neglects the ion temperature since the model equations present a singularity for a finite ion temperature. The multi-fluid simulations provide a rigorous solution to the plasma-sheath transition without singularities. We compare our solution to the classical theory, finding perfect agreement when the ion-to-electron temperature tends to zero. We discuss the effect of the ion temperature, the electron inertia, and the elastic collisions with neutrals in low-pressure plasmas. Finally, relying on a kinetic approach, we derive analytical expressions for the electron macroscopic quantities inside a steady sheath that assumes a truncated Maxwellian electron velocity distribution function (EVDF) with a wall that collects the electron random flux. The derived analytical expressions are beyond the classical isothermal solution with Boltzmann electrons. The isothermal multi-fluid solution captures properly the first two moments of the EVDF inside the sheath. Our analytical expressions show the need for solving for higher-order moments to fully explain the electron physics inside the sheath, as opposite to the classical isothermal assumption. This work demonstrates that the multi-fluid simulations are able to capture the plasma-sheath transition under weakly collisional conditions with a solution that is consistent with the classical and the kinetic theory.}

abstract = {In recent years, air-breathing electric propulsion emerged as a potential enabling technology for long-duration space missions in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO). In this work, we show how the complex relation between mission environment, spacecraft configuration, and propulsive performance can be associated to a single requirement for full air-breathing drag compensation, which becomes less stringent for higher VLEO orbits. The impact of the spacecraft shape and size on the performed analysis is then evaluated and the results compared with conventional electric propulsion solutions with stored propellant, showing how the adoption of air-breathing propulsion becomes more advantageous, from a volume and mass fraction perspective, when the spacecraft scale is reduced.}

abstract = {Renewed interest in Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO) - i.e. altitudes below 450 km - has led to an increased demand for accurate environment characterisation and aerodynamic force prediction. While the former requires knowledge of the mechanisms that drive density variations in the thermosphere, the latter also depends on the interactions between the gas-particles in the residual atmosphere and the surfaces exposed to the flow. The determination of the aerodynamic coefficients is hindered by the numerous uncertainties that characterise the physical processes occurring at the exposed surfaces. Several models have been produced over the last 60 years with the intent of combining accuracy with relatively simple implementations. In this paper the most popular models have been selected and reviewed using as discriminating factors relevance with regards to orbital aerodynamics applications and theoretical agreement with gas-beam experimental data. More sophisticated models were neglected, since their increased accuracy is generally accompanied by a substantial increase in computation times which is likely to be unsuitable for most space engineering applications. For the sake of clarity, a distinction was introduced between physical and scattering kernel theory based gas-surface interaction models. The physical model category comprises the Hard Cube model, the Soft Cube model and the Washboard model, while the scattering kernel family consists of the Maxwell model, the Nocilla-Hurlbut-Sherman model and the Cercignani-Lampis-Lord model. Limits and assets of each model have been discussed with regards to the context of this paper. Wherever possible, comments have been provided to help the reader to identify possible future challenges for gas-surface interaction science with regards to orbital aerodynamic applications.}

While the magnetic field confines the electrons in a stable plasma, the instability completely destroys the confinement such that the transport becomes independent of the magnetic field in the highly magnetized limit. An analytical expression of the instability-enhanced collision frequency is proposed, based on a magnetic field independent edge-to-center density ratio. }",

title = {Full fluid moment modeling of rotating spokes in Penning-type configuration},
journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
abstract = {Rotating spokes are observed in a partially magnetized plasma using a two-dimensional full fluid moment (FFM) model. In the present setup, where the radial electric field and plasma density gradient exist in opposite directions, it is observed that the spokes propagate in the direction of the diamagnetic drift and not the E × B drift. This is contrary to the modified Simon–Hoh instability, and the results suggest that the spokes can be driven by a strong diamagnetic drift. Different parameters, including magnetic field amplitude and physical domain size, influence the growth of the rotational instability as well as the dominant wave modes that arise. The propagation speed of the rotating spokes obtained from the FFM simulation are in good agreement with the observations in experimental and other computational work.}

  Abstract                 = {HaD-effect thruster flight measurements are compared with results from two-dimensional plume and three- dimensional spacecraft interactions computer simulations. The measurements were acquired onboard Express-A 2 and A 3, two Russian communications satellites in geosynchronus orbit. The spacecraft carry foul' propulsion units for east-west and north-south station keeping. Each unit consists of two stationary plasma thrusters. Ion flux and energy spectra were recorded at various positions with respect to the thrusters and are compared with, results from simulations using a uniform electron temperature, two-dimensional plume code that computes the expansion of the main ion beam by a fluid approach. The dynamics of the charge-exchange plasma are determined by a particle-in-cell method. Comparisons suggest good agreement for plume angles less than 40 deg and electl'On temperature between 8 and 11 e V. At approximately 4 and 9 m away from the thruster, and at plume angles less than 10 dcg, the discrepancy between measured and computed values is tound to be less than 10\%. At larger angles, ion flux measurements exhibit large variations during operation of the same thruster. At 80 deg and 1.35 m away from the thruster, flux sensors recorded current densities that ranged between 12 and 55 mA/m2. The two- dimensional corle computes 27 mA/m2 for an anode mass flow rate of 5.3 mg/s at this location. Moments induced on the spacecraft during the operation of each thruster were also recorded by the attitude control system and are compared with results from a three-dimensional spacecraft interactions code. These measUI'ements were taken during. rotation of the solar arrays.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional electromechanical model based on accurate calculations of inductance and a detailed description of the inhomogeneous magnetic field distribution which accelerates the plasma discharge produced by a miniaturised pulsed plasma thruster (μPPT) has been developed. The analytical model relates μPPT performance to electrode geometry parameters and circuit parameters and shows good agreement with experimental results. The theoretical study has shown that flared electrode geometries enhance performance by optimising the inductance gradient and hence the energy available to accelerate the plasma sheet. Thruster performance has been experimentally characterised for a discharge energy range of 1–8J for propellant surface areas of 0.15–1.5cm2. The performance of parallel electrode configurations has been shown to display a strong dependence on aspect ratio relative to that of flared geometries. Rectangular flared electrodes produce impulse bits considerably higher than parallel geometries under the same operating conditions. Results show that for configurations where aspect ratio may influence performance increases in electrode separation rather than decreases in electrode width produce enhanced performance for the same propellant surface area.}

    abstract = { In a pulsed plasma thruster discharge, the propellant utilization efficiency is commonly seen as the weak point for its thrust performance, and for its low thrust efficiency respectively. However, the value depends strongly on operational settings and the design of the pulsed plasma thruster itself. To access this efficiency to understand further the influence of parameters, a method combining experimental and modeling efforts is proposed within this paper. By using various optical methods, including high-speed camera imaging, emission spectroscopy, and Mach–Zehnder interferometry, the plasma bulk velocity for different energy configurations of the SPPT-68 ADD SIMP-LEX is derived. Together with the total ablated mass and an improved slug model, the ratio of mass accelerated in the discharge process is computed and, thus, the propellant utilization efficiency is derived. Velocities in the range of 25 to 55  km/s were measured, leading to propellant utilization efficiencies of about 40 to 60\% depending on the voltage and capacitance used in the pulsed plasma thruster. }

title = {Plasma deflagration and the properties of a coaxial plasma deflagration gun},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {The concept of plasma deflagration is investigated theoretically and experimentally. Deflagration is a heating process which adds energy to a flowing stream under expansion. The equations governing the process are the same as the detonation “snowplough” process; therefore, deflagration is nothing more than the second solution of the set of conservation equations.

The deflagration process is thoroughly studied in the field of chemical combustion. An analogy between combustion and magnetized plasma is made, and the second law of thermodynamics is invoked in the discussion on the limits of the existence of deflagration solutions. The deflagration process that occurs in a gaseous discharge can accelerate particles to very high velocities at relatively low thermal energy. The deflagration discharge wave always propagates towards the high gas pressure and the high magnetic field region. The wave can be made stationary by injecting neutral gas into the wave. The discharge zone is thick, which reduces the local current density with a given total current and the erosion of electrodes can thus be reduced.

A coaxial plasma gun has been designed, based on the deflagration principle, which demonstrates the features predicted by the deflagration hypothesis. The energy of the plasma stream thus produced exceeds 10 keV (&gt; 108 cm/sec with D2).The discharge wave is found to be thick and the wave is quasi-stationary inside the gun barrel. Besides the high velocity capabilities, the gun can focus the plasma to a very small area. This provides a unique opportunity to perform plasma injection experiments with strong magnetic fields (&gt; 100 kG).}

These plasmas are characterized by a quasi-neutral bulk that is joined to the wall by a thin boundary layer called sheath that is positively charged. Although analytical solutions are available in the sheath and the pre-sheath, joining the two areas by one analytical solution is still an open problem which requires the numerical resolution of the fluid equations coupled to Poisson equation. Current numerical schemes use high-order discretizations to correctly capture the electron current in the sheath, presenting unsatisfactory results in the boundary layer and they are not adapted to all the possible collisional regimes. In this work, we identify the main numerical challenges that arise when attempting the simulations of such configuration and we propose explanations for the observed phenomena via numerical analysis. We propose a numerical scheme with controlled diffusion as well as new discrete boundary conditions that address the identified issues.}",

  Abstract                 = {A mechanism for ambipolar ion acceleration in a magnetic nozzle is proposed. The plasma is adiabatic (i.e., does not exchange energy with its surroundings) in the diverging section of a magnetic nozzle so any energy lost by the electrons must be transferred to the ions via the electric field. Fluid theory indicates that the change in plasma potential is proportional to the change in average electron energy. These predictions were compared to measurements in the VX-200 experiment which has conditions conducive to ambipolar ion acceleration. A planar Langmuir probe was used to measure the plasma potential, electron density, and electron temperature for a range of mass flow rates and power levels. Axial profiles of those parameters were also measured, showing consistency with the adiabatic ambipolar fluid theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Computing comprises three distinct strands: hardware, software and the ways they are used in real or imagined worlds. Its use in research is more than writing or running code. Having something significant to compute and deploying judgement in what is attempted and achieved are especially c{Hall}enging. In science or engineering, one must define a central problem in computable form, run such software as is appropriate and, last but by no means least, convince others that the results are both valid and useful. These several strands are highly interdependent. A major scientific development can transform disparate aspects of information and computer technologies. Computers affect the way we do science, as well as changing our personal worlds. Access to information is being transformed, with consequences beyond research or even science. Creativity in research is usually considered uniquely human, with inspiration a central factor. Scientific and technological needs are major forces in innovation, and these include hardware and software opportunities. One can try to define the scientific needs for established technologies (atomic energy, the early semiconductor industry), for rapidly developing technologies (advanced materials, microelectronics) and for emerging technologies (nanotechnology, novel information technologies). Did these needs define new computing, or was science diverted into applications of then-available codes? Regarding credibility, why is it that engineers accept computer realizations when designing engineered structures, whereas predictive modelling of materials has yet to achieve industrial confidence outside very special cases? The tensions between computing and traditional science are complex, unpredictable and potentially powerful.},

  Abstract                 = {A new and innovative type of gridded ion thruster, the {D}ual-{S}tage 4-Grid or {DS4G} concept, has been proven under laboratory conditions under a preliminary research, development and test programme. The DS4G concept is able to operate at very high specific impulse, power and thrust density values well in excess of conventional 3-grid ion thrusters at the expense of a higher power-to-thrust ratio. A small low-power experimental laboratory model was designed and built, and its performance was measured during an extensive test campaign. The principal goals of the initial laboratory experiment were to prove the practical feasibility of the overall concept, demonstrate the performance predicted by analytical and simulation models, and investigate critical design parameters and technological c{Hall}enges. In the present paper, the basic concept of the DS4G ion thruster is presented, along with the design, operating parameters and measured performance obtained from the first and second phases of the experimental campaign. Finally, the implications of these findings for future gridded ion thruster developments and future mission applications are addressed. I.}

  Abstract                 = {Perivascular space (PVS) within the brain is an important pathway for interstitial fluid (ISF) and solute transport. Fluid flowing in the PVS can affect these transport processes and has significant impacts on physiology. In this paper, we carry out a theoretical analysis to investigate the fluid mechanics in the PVS. With certain assumptions and approximations, we are able to find an analytical solution to the problem. We discuss the physical meanings of the solution and particularly examine the consequences of the induced fluid flow in the context of convection-enhanced delivery (CED). We conclude that peristaltic motions of the blood vessel walls can facilitate fluid and solute transport in the PVS.},

A Pulsed Plasma Thruster to perform drag compensation for a Cubesat platform, with the aim of doubling the time needed for the Cubesat to naturally de-orbit (hence doubling its lifetime) is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd., Mars Space Ltd. and the University of Southampton under an ESA funded project. In this paper the design of the thruster will be presented together with preliminary experimental results. The preliminary test results suggest that the thruster will be able to meet the mission requirements.}

The theoretical model is validated by comparisons to experiments of a wide range of geometries and operating conditions showing very good agreement. The produced expressions quantify contributions from electromagnetic and gas dynamic acceleration; confirm, explain, and generalize trends observed by experiments; and offer additional guidelines for thruster improvements. }

The measurements are carried out using an array of six axially distributed dual-Rogowski coils in a balanced circuit configuration. The radial current distributions indicate that operation in the gas-puff mode, i.e., the mode in which the electrode voltage is applied before injection of the gas, results in a stationary ionization front consistent with the presence of a plasma deflagration. The effects of varying the bank capacitance, transmission line inductance, and applied electrode voltage were studied over the range from 14 to 112 μF, 50 to 200 nH, and 1 to 3 kV, respectively.}",

abstract = {Micro-Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (μPPTs) are a promising method for precision attitude control for small spacecraft in formation flying. They create an ionized plasma plume, which may interfere with other spacecraft in the formation. To characterize the ions in the plume, a diagnostic has been built that couples a drift tube with an energy analyzer. The drift tube provides time of flight measurements to determine the exhaust velocity, and the energy analyzer discriminates the ion energies. The energy analyzer measures the current on a collector plate downstream of four grids that repel electrons and ions below a specified energy. The first grid lowers the density of the plasma, therefore increasing Debye length. The second and fourth grids have a negative potential applied to them so they repel the electrons, while the third grid's voltage can be varied to repel lower energy ions. The ion energies can be computed by differentiating the data. Combining the information of the ion energies and their velocities identifies the ion masses in the PPT plume. The PPT used for this diagnostic is the micro-PPT developed for the Dawgstar satellite. This PPT uses 5.2 Joules per pulse and has a 2.3 cm2 propellant area, a 1.3 cm electrode length, and an estimated thrust of 85μN [C. Rayburn et al., AIAA-2000-3256]. This paper will describe the development and design of the time of flight/gridded energy analyzer diagnostic and present recent experimental results.}

abstract = {Technological miniaturization has enabled the development of small satellites weighing as little as 1 kg. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of suitable efficient micropropulsion systems at these scales. The pulsed plasma thruster is a structurally simple form of electric propulsion. This simplicity also makes it ideally suited for miniaturization. Its history can be traced back to applications in satellites that are much larger than micro/nano-satellites. The vast majority of modern pulsed plasma thrusters use solid polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a propellant. Unfortunately, at lower discharge energy levels such as those necessitated by the power limitations of micro/nano-satellites, PTFE has a tendency to exhibit carbon deposition, which can ultimately lead to thruster failure. In this new era of small satellites, it is important to consider alternative propellants in the miniaturization of pulsed plasma thrusters. This brief review discusses the needs and limitations of small satellites and alternative propellants that may be able to meet these needs. Such propellants may be able to offer advantages such as a longer thruster lifetime, a higher specific impulse, or a higher thrust-to-power ratio. This would enable the development of different types of pulsed plasma thrusters that can be tailored towards specific mission requirements.}

abstract = {At present, very few CubeSats have flown in space featuring propulsion systems. Of those that have, the literature is scattered, published in a variety of formats (conference proceedings, contractor websites, technical notes, and journal articles), and often not available for public release. This paper seeks to collect the relevant publically releasable information in one location. To date, only two missions have featured propulsion systems as part of the technology demonstration. The IMPACT mission from the Aerospace Corporation launched several electrospray thrusters from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and BricSAT-P from the United States Naval Academy had four micro-Cathode Arc Thrusters from George Washington University. Other than these two missions, propulsion on CubeSats has been used only for attitude control and reaction wheel desaturation via cold gas propulsion systems. As the desired capability of CubeSats increases, and more complex missions are planned, propulsion is required to accomplish the science and engineering objectives. This survey includes propulsion systems that have been designed specifically for the CubeSat platform and systems that fit within CubeSat constraints but were developed for other platforms. Throughout the survey, discussion of flight heritage and results of the mission are included where publicly released information and data have been made available. Major categories of propulsion systems that are in this survey are solar sails, cold gas propulsion, electric propulsion, and chemical propulsion systems. Only systems that have been tested in a laboratory or with some flight history are included.}

    abstract = "{The plasma plume of a 1 J pulsed plasma thruster fed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was studied with electric probes to obtain the shape and composition of the beam of ejected ions. Two ion diagnostic tools—Faraday cup (FC) and retarding potential analyzer (RPA), were employed together with a time-of-flight approach. The FC was used to obtain spatially and time-resolved data of the mean ion charge expelled from the thruster in each pulse. With the RPA the beam was examined for the presence of specific ion species. The results of this investigation indicated the presence of both elements of PTFE in the beam—fluorine and carbon as well as copper from the discharge electrodes. Fluorine ions (identified in charge-states from F+ up to F6+) constituted the majority of ions in the plume with only trace amounts of C+ detected, which raises the question on the whereabouts of the remaining carbon. Energy distribution and relative abundance of fluorine ion species on axis were retrieved and it was found that F2+ constitutes over 40\\% of the plasma—in both quantity and energy fraction. Angular profiles of ion charge density, apart from the expected azimuthal asymmetry, showed heightened flux of ions in the area shaded by the discharge electrodes. The results obtained from both diagnostics allowed us to calculate propellant utilization, beam divergence, and energy utilization. By combining this information, the total thruster efficiency was retrieved, which turned out to be comparable to the value obtained from impulse bit measurements.}",
